<h2>The Cages Facility</h2>
	<p> The Cages is an indoor baseball facility with everything you will need to get better everyday. It has an indoor infield where teams can get their ground balls like in an actual field. We also have 4 cages to hit, 2 of them have pitching matchines and 2 without them for BP throwing sessions. The facility can be rented for teams practices or trainers that would like to train their athlethes in our facility. We also have a gym area and pro shop with supplements for the gym and baseball gear. </p>

<h3>The Cages Gym</h3>
	<p> The Gym in our facility has a variety of training equipment. It is always full with thriving people from the baseball comunity where you can create connections and training partners that would help eachother get better everyday. It is a well design space with free weight and space to even do some conditioning after the weights. We are working on adding a Sauna to our gym facility which will take it to another level when it comes to baseball training facilities. </p>
