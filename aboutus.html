<h2> The Cages </h2>
	<p>The Cages is a project I have always wanted to build with my dad. We always talked about building a baseball training facility when I graduate college as a family business for when he retires. I have been playing the sport of baseball since I was 4 years old. I am from Puerto Rico where baseball is one of the most played sports and you can see it in the MLB with all the puertorrican players. </p>

<h3> The Cages Mission </h3>
	<p> Our mission is to give everyone the same amount of opportunity to be their best self. Dedicate time to our new generations and to keep growing the sport we love to a level of expertise. Inspire kids and teenagers to not give up and that the difference between the imposible and the possible lies in your determination to get better everyday. We surround problems with different perspectives, united by our values and determination. </p>

<h3>Our Values</h3>
	<p> Here in the cages we have 5 values we go by. The values are Teamwork, Respect, Sportmanship, Perseverance, and Equality. This helps us and our employees work towards the same goals. It supports our company mission and shape our culture.   </p>
